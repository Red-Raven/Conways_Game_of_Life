FEATURES:

[DONE]User-defined grid size.
User-defined iteration speed, or user-option to iterate on button press.
User-defined rules (Standard: B3/S23).
Help command for rules and controls.
Restart command that let's the user set a new board afer ending the last board or reaching a repeating board.

b/c the board can load while waiting for input.

Update comments.
General clean up. Possible optimization and modulation.
Use more meaningful variables.
