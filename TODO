FEATURES:

[DONE]User-defined grid size.
User-defined iteration speed, or user-option to iterate on button press.
User-defined rules (Standard: B3/S23).
Help command for rules and controls.
Restart command that let's the user set a new board afer ending the last board or reaching a repeating board.
Command that allows user to stop automatic/endless mode.
Endless mode that randomly generates new cells once board is dead. User-defined repitition length will trigger it.
Spaces b/w ASCII characters to make grid more even.
GUI (colored clickable grid squares, buttons for commands, zooming)
Ability to save/load grids.
Command that allows user to choose wether or not the board is cleared or the next one is printed below the last one.
Allow users to choose wheather toriodal array is used, or the edges remain dead at all times.

Modes: Single Step, automatic, endless.

TODO:
[Done]Clear board after each iteration.
Move cammand input so that the nextBoard is calculated, then the command is taken. This will be more efficient
b/c the board can load while waiting for input.

WHEN FINISHED:
Update comments.
General clean up. Possible optimization and modulation.
Use more meaningful variables.

Just for fun, if possible, create a massive simulation that reaches the maximum limit reachable with ints or doubles.
Must add tons of efficiency algorithms. Focus one ones that skip dead space and predict oscillators & gliders.

Essentially, I want to add every feature imaginable to this list. I'll get to some things, but not all. I just want to
have a full list to choose from, so leave any additions you have in the comments please.
